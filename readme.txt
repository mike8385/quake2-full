This is a call of duty zombies clone mod for Quake 2. 
It includes a buying system through the command line to get perks and Weapons.
It also has rounds and zombies spawning like the actual game. A few bugs but overall it works fine.

STEPS TO INSTALL:
0.) Just incase you run into the same issues I did, you might want to download Yamagi 
so it can run the game without bugs and crashing.
